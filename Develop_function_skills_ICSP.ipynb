    "#### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2011, The Australian Government (Department of Health and Ageing) made changes to the way that injectable chemotherapy was paid for in private hospitals via the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Locally known as Intravenous Chemotherapy Supply Programme, the programme resulted in changes in how the price paid to the hospital (or pharmacy services provider) was calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "These changes described above impacted both independent contractors who provided pharmacy services to private hospitals (Section 90) and internal pharmacy departments (Section 94).\n",
    "We need your help to calculate the impact that these changes will have on the remuneration for chemotherapy. By working through the steps below we want to get you in to a position to be able to address assist with this problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, the lowest cost combination of vials was calculated i.e., if the dose was for 1,200 mg and the medication in question came in 500mg (costing AUD 450ea.) and 100mg (costing AUD100ea.) vials – the lowest cost combination would be x2 500mg plus 2x 100mg vials (i.e., AUD1,100) (as opposed to x3 500mg vials, AUD1,350 plus 300mg wastage). The lowest cost combinations will always be provided for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the lowest cost combination had been established, a sliding scale markup needed to be applied. Depending on the cost, either a percentage amount was added, or a fixed fee was added, See Table below.\n",

This function should return the correct value (i.e. depending on whether or not it was subject to GST.)\n",
